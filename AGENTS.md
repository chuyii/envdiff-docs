## Code Contribution Guidelines

After making any changes to the codebase, **please ensure the following commands are executed before submitting your work**:

```bash
npm run lint     # Run the linter to check for code quality issues
npm run format   # Automatically format the code according to the project's style guide
npm run test     # Run all tests to ensure your changes don't break anything
```

Following these steps helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
